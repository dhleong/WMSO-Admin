An experiment with AppEngine, to see if I could build a nice, flexible CMS to use for my
orchestra's website. Because the IT department didn't want to give me a database, I wrote this with the
intention to generate static output to be pushed automatically to a remote server. As a consequence of this
decision (and my general lack of understanding about AppEngine at the time) efficiency is generally not bothered with. 

Uses a custom Java Applet to upload updated files via SFTP to the remote server. I'll release the
source for that at some point.
